        <p>To define them simply, Mummers are costumed entertainers that welcome in the New Year. Some of the earliest
            mummers date back to early Egypt, pagan Rome and Greece, England, Germany, and France. Historically, Mummery
            has influenced customs and perpetuated many interesting traditions. Every nation had its festivals at one
            time or another, each marked by parades and displays of fanciful costumes. </p>
